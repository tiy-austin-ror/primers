# Primers

## Whats the deal with these?

The primers found in this repository are single subject resurces to aid in completing assignments and subject retention. However, it is worth knowing what these are _not_ as much as it is knowing what they are.

These primers are not:
  - A tutorial
  - An exhaustive resource on a given subject.
  - A cheatsheet, giving you only the commands you need.


## Can I write my own primer or suggest one?
Most of these primers came from student suggestions and so suggestions for new primers are always welcome. If you'd like to write your own, I would stronly encourage that. The format I use is listed below.

## Format for a primer
Most primers in this repo follow a very similar pattern.
  - A description or steps to get started
  - Definitions of terms or common commands
  - A list of examples or
  - Additional resources
